Back-End

Introduction to React
- it’s a library that employs web pack to automatically compile 
React, JSX, ES6
- JavaScript based Front-end development library
- It’s a declarative, component based library that allows developers to 
build reusable components and it follows the Virtual DOM approach


How React Works ?
- it operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than 
directly manipulating the browser’s DOM

How DOM Works ?
Example:
document.getElementById(“username”).innerValue = ‘updated value’;

1. Browser parses the HTML to find the node with this id
2. It removes the child element of specific element
3. Update the element with updated value
4. Recalculate CSS for parent and child nodes
5. Update the layout
6. Finally traverse the tree and paint it on the screen (browser)


How virtual DOM helps React ?
- In react, everything is treated as a component 
- A component can contain a state
- Whenever state of any component is changed react updates it’s virtual DOM

React maintains two Virtual DOM at each time, one contains the 
updated Virtual DOM and one which is just the pre-update version 
of this updated Virtual DOM.
Now it compares the pre-updated version with updated Virtual DOM
This process of comparing virtual DOM with previous one is known as diffing

React uses a concept of batch update to update the real DOM
It means that the changes to the real DOM are sent in batches instead of 
Sending any update for a single change in the state of a component. 
The process of sending changes to real DOM is known as reconciliation.

============================

Features of React
1. JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension  /  JavaScript XML
  - JSX combines HTML and JavaScript - allows you to embed JavaScript objects with HTML elements

const username = "Ravi";

// Vanilla JS
let div = document.createElement("div");
div.innerText = "Welcome : " + username;
div.className = "container";

// React JSX
let div = <div className="container">Welcome {username}</div>


Getting started with React
1. Install NodeJS
2. npm create vite@latest my-first-app
3. cd my-first-app
4. npm install
5. npm run dev
