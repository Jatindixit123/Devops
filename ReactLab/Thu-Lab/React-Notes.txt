React
- it's a JavaScript based front-end development library
- it was introduced in 2013 by Facebook
- it provides various extensions for web application architectural support
such as flux, react native and much more
- helpful in web application development and mobile application development
- it's a declarative apporach, component based library that allows developer
to build reusable UI components and follows Virtual DOM apporach

How React Works ?
- it operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating browser's DOM
- Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of DOM
- Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of actual DOM
- It is exactly same as DOM but it does not have power to directly change layout of the document


Disadvantages of DOM
- whenever DOM gets updated, the updated element and its child have to rendered again to update UI of page
- manipulating DOM is a slow process


How virtual DOM helps React to perform better ?
- everything in react is treated as a component
- each component has a state
- whenever state of any component is changed react immediately updates the virtual DOM tree
- react maintains two virtual DOM at each time
- one contains the updated virtual DOM and one which is the previous version
- Now it compares the previous one with the updated one and figure out the exact changes
- this whole process of comparing is known as diffing
- the entire process of transforming changes to real DOM is knonw as reconciliation


JSX
- JavaScript Extension

Vanilla JavaScript
const username = "John";
let div = document.createElement("div");
div.innerText = "Welcome : " + username;
div.className = "wrapper";


JSX Syntax
const username = "John";
let div = <div className="wrapper">Welcome : {username}</div>


Getting started with React
1. Install NodeJS
2. node -v
3. npx create-react-app app-name
   npm i web-vitals --save-dev
4. cd app-name
5. npm start


For permissions issue in windows
Open powershell as admin
Type -> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted


Alternate way to build react application
- Using vite - to create a lightweight react application

Commands
- npm create vite@latest my-second-app
- framework - react
- variant - JavaScript
- cd my-second-app
- npm install
- npm run dev
