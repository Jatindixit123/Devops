Front-End Developer - JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular

React
- it's a JavaScript based front-end development library
- it was introduced in 2013 by Facebook
- it provides various extensions for web application architectural support
such as flux, react native and much more
- helpful in web application development and mobile application development
- it's a declarative apporach, component based library that allows developer
to build reusable UI components and follows Virtual DOM apporach

How React Works ?
- it operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating browser's DOM
- Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of DOM
- Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of actual DOM
- It is exactly same as DOM but it does not have power to directly change layout of the document


Disadvantages of DOM
- whenever DOM gets updated, the updated element and its child have to rendered again to update UI of page
- manipulating DOM is a slow process


How virtual DOM helps React to perform better ?
- everything in react is treated as a component
- each component has a state
- whenever state of any component is changed react immediately updates the virtual DOM tree
- react maintains two virtual DOM at each time
- one contains the updated virtual DOM and one which is the previous version
- Now it compares the previous one with the updated one and figure out the exact changes
- this whole process of comparing is known as diffing
- the entire process of transforming changes to real DOM is knonw as reconciliation


Features of React
1. JSX
- JavaScript Syntax Extension
- it combines HTML and JavaScript that allows us to embed JS objects with HTML

Vanilla JS
const username = "Ravi";
document.createElement("div").innerText = "Welcome " + username;

JSX
const username = "Ravi";
const element = <div>Welcome {username}</div>


2. One-way Data Binding
- React follows one-way data binding where data flows from parent to child component
- Child component cannot directly return data to its parent component



Getting started with react
1. Install NodeJS
2. CRA - Create React App 
3. npx create-react-app app-name

npm i web-vitals --save-dev
