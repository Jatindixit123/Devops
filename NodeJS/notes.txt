NodeJS
- JavaScript Runtime environment 
- runs on chrome V8 Engine
- allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser making it useful for server side development
- Event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture

V8 Engine
- JavaScript Engine inside chrome
- written on C++
- used in chrome
- compiles and executes JavaScript source code

Compilation of JS
- it is considered as an interpreted language
- but modern JavaScript engine no longer just interpret but they compile it

JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with JIT (JUST-IN-TIME) compilation to speed up the execution

JIT Compiler
- it's a program that compiles code while a program is running

Compilation during execution - compile code while a progra is running
Byte code to machine code - translare bytecode into machine code
Dynamic compilation - it allows program to be compiled at runtime
